Ark Query
=========
This is a little commandline tool which checks an ARK account for recent transactions matching a given pattern, within a given date range.

I wrote it because the profits from ARK dPOS voting are nice, but the daily entries make my tax accounting a hassle.
Using CoinTracking, I can get a tax report, down to the tiniest fraction of what I've earned daily.

If you use and love this app, please consider donating some ARK to me at: AUhmkVVYAZhqgM8mzRLaCUpZSHXk9e534Q
