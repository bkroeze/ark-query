Ark Vote Tracker
================
This is a little commandline tool which checks an ARK account for recent transactions matching a given pattern, within a given date range.
If it finds any such transactions, it adds them to your [CoinTracking.info](https://cointracking.info?ref=B456545) account.

I wrote it because the profits from ARK dPOS voting are nice, but the daily entries make my tax accounting a hassle.
Using CoinTracking, I can get a tax report, down to the tinies fraction of what I've earned daily.
